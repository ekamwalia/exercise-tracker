### Exercise Tracker

An exercise tracker API that uses MongoDB(mLab) to register users and keep track of their exercise regime. Developed as a part of freecodecamp's [API and Microservice Projects](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker). This API is not fit for practical use.

The API uses MongoDB on mLab cloud to store user and their exercise logs. Some features are : 
- Register a user
- Add a new exercise log
- Query all logs for a user
- Select all logs for a user in a given time period using _from_ and _to_ date params
- View a specific number of logs using a _limit_ param
